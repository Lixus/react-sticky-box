# Full Page Example

This page mostly serves to verify that it's also working if the window serves as scroll container. (Which probably is the most common case)

<Bg>
  <Row>
    <ContentBox size="xs" />
  </Row>
  <Row>
    <StickySidebar offsetTop={20} offsetBottom={20} elements={20} client:idle />
    <ContentBox size="lg">
      <p>The sidebar to the left stays in a sticky position.</p>
      <p>
        Go ahead and hit the <b>expand</b> button to see how it behaves once the sidebar becomes
        greater than the viewport.
      </p>
    </ContentBox>
  </Row>
  <Row>
    <ContentBox size="md" />
  </Row>
</Bg>
